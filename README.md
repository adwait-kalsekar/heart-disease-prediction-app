# Algorithmic Machine Learning Project
### Made by Group 6:
* Adwait Kalsekar 
* Yunqiao Xu 
* Nidhi Jha
* Jiahe Su
* Chenghao Jiang

This project was developed as the Final Project for the Algorithmic Machine Learning Course.
It focuses on Binary Classification Models for predicting whether a patient has a Heart Disease or not, based on the parameters.

## Features

- The project was created using django - a python backend framework
- Machine Learning models were made by leveraging open source libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib
- You can view the entire presentation on the Initial tabs of the application.
- The final model is deployed to the "Try the Project" section, which can be tried.


## Steps to setup project locally

1. Make sure python and pip is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the project in a directory.
3. Create a python virtual environment inside the clone directory.
4. Activate the virtual environment and run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Finally run 
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
or
```sh
python3 manage.py runserver
```
based on your operating system

6. Go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
